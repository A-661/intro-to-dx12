# Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12 source code

## Introduction

Forked and detached from the [sample code repo]((https://github.com/d3dcoder/d3d12book)) for Frank D. Luna's excellent book [Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12](http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d12.htm). The source code is presented here for convenience (so you don't need to dig up the physical media of the book) and remains the copyright of Frank D. Luna.

## Changes

All projects have been retargeted to use the latest Windows SDK.
