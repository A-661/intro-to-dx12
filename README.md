# Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12 source code

Forked and detached from the [sample code repo]((https://github.com/d3dcoder/d3d12book)) for Frank D. Luna's excellent book [Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12](http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d12.htm).

The source code is presented here for convenience (so you don't need to dig up the physical media of the book) and remains the copyright of the book authors.

I'm currently going through each project and retargeting them to the latest Windows SDK and VS2019.
